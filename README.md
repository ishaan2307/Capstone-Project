# IoT Capstone Project – Sensor Integration and Real-Time Data Visualization

## Overview  
This repository documents my contributions as an **IoT Developer** for a capstone project focused on real-time environmental and physiological monitoring. The goal was to integrate multiple sensors into a unified system that collected, processed, and visualized data in real time to support intelligent decision-making and research applications.

As a junior member of the team, I was responsible for configuring, testing, and integrating key sensors and ensuring reliable communication between hardware and software layers.

## Key Contributions  

### 1. DHT Temperature & Humidity Sensor  
- Configured and calibrated the **DHT11/DHT22 sensor** for accurate temperature and humidity readings.  
- Ensured stable data transmission between the sensor and the Arduino microcontroller.  
- Verified sensor precision through multiple test runs and environmental simulations.  

### 2. MAX30102 & MAX30205 Sensor Modules  
- Successfully implemented **MAX30102** (heart rate & SpO₂ sensor) and **MAX30205** (body temperature sensor).  
- Resolved initialization and signal acquisition issues, ensuring reliable sensor performance.  
- Provided technical assistance to teammates for integration into the combined IoT pipeline.  

### 3. Serial Communication & Real-Time Data Logging  
- Used **Arduino IDE** to open and monitor the **COM port** for continuous sensor data streaming.  
- Wrote a serial listener program to read live sensor values from the COM port and store them for analysis.  
- Implemented Python scripts for **real-time plotting** of temperature, humidity, and heart rate data, visualizing live trends and anomalies.
